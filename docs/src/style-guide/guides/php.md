# PHP

As Laravel follows [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) & [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md)
We should try to maintain those standards.  

Where we do deviate, is that we should employ [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) where we can.
